# lamudiAnalysis
Hey! This is a repository where I show you the code tha I used to scrape lamudi site in order to get the data of rent information in places in CDMX.

I used scrapy with Python to extract the information and a MongoDB instance to store the data.

Also you can find an explanatory analysis of this data.
